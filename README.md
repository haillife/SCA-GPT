# SCA-GPT: A Generation-Planning-Tool Assisted LLM Agent for Fully Automated Side-Channel Analysis on Cryptosystems

Non-invasive security constitutes an essential component of hardware security, primarily involving side-channel analysis (SCA), with various international standards explicitly mandating rigorous testing. However, current SCA assessments heavily depend on expert manual procedures, resulting in significant expenditures of time and resources. Automated evaluation frameworks are not yet available. In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted in various fields owing to their emergent capabilities. Particularly, LLM agents equipped with tool-usage capabilities have significantly expanded the potential of these models to interact with the physical world.
Motivated by these recent advances in LLM agents, we propose SCA-GPT, an end-to-end automated LLM agent framework tailored for SCA tasks. The framework integrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based expert knowledge base with multiple SCA tools to enable fully automated ISO/IEC 17825-compliant testing. As a core component of SCA-GPT, the expert knowledge base serves as the agent’s long-term memory, enabling precise retrieval and contextual reasoning during automated testing. We further present a domain-specific expert knowledge
base construction approach and two complementary evaluation metrics.
Retrieval experiments validate the effectiveness of our knowledge base construction, achieving strong performance with 84.44% and 98.33% on two complementary retrieval quality metrics (Q@5 and nDCG@5). We further evaluate the overall framework across three leading LLMs—DeepSeek V3.1, Kimi K2 and Qwen3 Coder—using datasets spanning six cryptographic algorithms (e.g., AES, DES, RSA, ECDSA) and deploying on four hardware platforms, including smart cards, microcontrollers, and FPGAs. Results show that DeepSeek V3.1, Kimi K2, and Qwen3 Coder achieve accuracies of 83.8%, 77.8%, and 91.4%, respectively, with the agent reducing testing time by an average of 95.7% compared with manual procedures. Notably, SCA-GPT is the first advanced LLM agent specifically designed for SCA tasks.
