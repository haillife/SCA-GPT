# Artemis-A-Knowledge-Infused-LLM-Agent-for-Automated-Non-Invasive-Security-Evaluation

Non-invasive security constitutes an essential component of hardware security, primarily involving side-channel analysis (SCA), with various international standards explicitly mandating rigorous testing. However, current SCA assessments heavily depend on expert manual procedures, resulting in significant expenditures of time and resources. Automated evaluation frameworks are not yet available.
In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted in various fields such as language generation, owing to their emergent capabilities. Particularly, LLM agents equipped with tool-usage capabilities have significantly expanded the potential of these models to interact with the physical world.
Addressing this challenge, we propose Artemis, a LLM agent framework tailored for SCA tasks. The framework incorporates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based expert knowledge base along with multiple SCA tools. By effectively infusing expert knowledge, Artemis achieves fully automated, end-to-end ISO/IEC 17825-compliant tests. We conduct comprehensive experiments across three leading LLMs—DeepSeek V3, Kimi K2 and GLM 4.5—using datasets spanning seven cryptographic algorithms (e.g., AES, RSA, ECC, Kyber) and deploying on four hardware platforms, including smart cards, microcontrollers, and FPGAs. Results show that DeepSeek V3, Kimi K2, and GLM 4.5 achieve accuracies of 96.4\%, 93.0\%, and 87.5\%, respectively, with the agent reducing testing time by an average of 76\% compared with manual procedures. Notably, Artemis is the first advanced LLM agent specifically designed for SCA tasks.
